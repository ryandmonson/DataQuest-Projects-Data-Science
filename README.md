Data Science Projects from DataQuest

This repo showcases the projects I've completed for the Data Analyst/Data Scientist program in the on line bootcamp Dataquest.io. Most of these projects were done in Jupyter notebooks.

Guided Project 20 - Kaggle submission workflow using SciKit Learn built-in methods for best features and best model selection 

Guided Project 19 - Handwritten digit classifier using K Nearest Neighbor and Neural Network analysis

Guided Project 18 - Predict bike rentals using Linear Regression and Decision Tree analysis 

Guided Project 17 - Evaluate Airplane accidents.  Coding done in a text editor

Guided Project 16- Predict Stock market using Linear Regression and moving averages, volume as predictors.  Coding done in a text editor as opposed to Jupyter Notebook.

Guided Project 15- Identify most popular tags for questions on the Data Science Stack Exchange

Guided Project 14- Multi Variable Regression modeling of Home Prices

Guided Project 13 - KNN classification for predicting car prices

Guided Project 12 - Evaluate Jeopardy questions/answers for word match, questions when previously used

Guided Project 11 - Spam filter using an algorithm based on the Naive Bayes Theorem
